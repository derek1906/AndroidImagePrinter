# AndroidPathPrinter
This repository contains several jython scripts for transforming images into commands that gets sent to an Android device as touch signals.

Note that `print_points.py` and `print_path.py` are Jython scripts, not Python scripts.

## Assumptions
This assumes the device's screen with is 1440. Adjust the code accordingly for different screen sizes.

## `print_points.py`
This script reads in a png image and "draws" it on the device's screen. A color has to specified (in the code) in order to filter out pixels that should not be drawn.

## `print_path.py`
This scripts reads in an svg image, converts it to a series of commands and draws it on the device's screen. This is different than `print_points` where this prints out actual paths.

This script is considerably way more complex than `print_points`. Although it uses `svg.path` to parse the SVG path, all the points are generated by the script according to the SVG specification. It will also fill in the spaces by generating lines from left to right, using a modified rasterization algorithm.

Images will be centered. A scaling factor can be added.

## `shapes.py`
It contains classes that `print_path.py` needs to generate space filling lines.

## Dependencies
- [`MonkeyRunner`](https://developer.android.com/studio/test/monkeyrunner/index.html) from Android SDK
- [`svg.path` 2.2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/svg.path) 
- Numpy for matrix calculations

Install with

    pip install svg.path

## Restrictions
Image size cannot be larger than 144x144 for `print_points`, and width cannot exceed 1440px for `print_path`.

## How to Run
Run the scripts with MonkeyRunner.

    # print_points
    monkeyrunner print_points.py my_image.png

    # print_path
    monkeyrunner print_path.py my_image.svg

MonkeyRunner usual locations:

- Mac: `~/Library/Android/sdk/tools/bin/monkeyrunner`
- Linux: `/usr/local/bin/sdk/tools/monkeyrunner`

## Why?
This was originally developed to automate the process of drawing perfect pictures in the mobile game DrawSomething. #JustCompSciThings

Unfortunately they have some sort weird movement capturing algorithm that makes it impossible to input perfect images with the `print_path.py` method. The dot matrix method however still works as expected but with a low resolution.
